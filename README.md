# MultiStatsd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bigcartel/multi-statsd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/bigcartel/multi-statsd) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/bigcartel/multi-statsd.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/bigcartel/multi-statsd)

An eventmachine-based statsd server written in ruby with a modular backend system.
The motivation behind creating Yet Another Statsd Server was that while the existing ones allowed
you to specify different backends to flush data to, it was always aggregated the same way and flushed on the same interval.
This library incurs the overhead of multiple copies of your statistics with the tradeoff that you
can have backend-specific flush intervals and alternate aggregations of your data.

## Installation

    $ gem install multi-statsd
    
## Configuration

Configuration is done via a YAML file which is specified on the command line. Example config file:

    # Host and port to listen on
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 8125
    verbosity: 1 # 0-4, 0 being the most verbose
    logfile: /var/log/multi-statsd.log
    pidfile: /var/run/multi-statsd.pid
    daemonize: true
    backends:
      stdout_every_5:
        backend: Stdout
        flush_interval: 5
      hottie:
        backend: Hottie
        host: 127.0.0.1
        port: 6379
        flush_interval: 1
        seconds_to_retain: 60


## Usage

Usage is straight forward:

    $ multi-statsd -c /path/to/config
